uFldHazardSensor 
  - Re-added the capability to limit classification requests
    based on a fixed interval of time (configured by "min_classify_interval")
  - Added ability to switch Pd settings as often as desired.

uXMS 
  - removed debug output in the --all mode
  - fixed bug that affected uXMS operation in AppCasting 

pMarineViewer
  - more robustness checking/handling for edge cases in MOOSGeodesy that was
    causing pMarineViewer crashes in some Linux distros, e.g., Ubuntu 12.10
  - fixed bug that caused left/right mouse context collisions when there was
    a context id shared by both the left and right mouse context config.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
13.2.1
------------------------------------------------------------------------------
BHV_Waypoint - added the wptflag parameter to support user-configured posting of 
   flags upon arriving at each waypoint. This allows easy configuration of a 
   mission where the the vehicle stops and station-keeps at each waypoint for 
   a sensor measurement. The wptflag parameter may also embed the location of the
   waypoint, for example "wptflag = NEW_POINT=$[X],$[Y]"

pMarineViewer - support for tiff_viewable=false to allow users to bring up 
   the viewer without the background image at startup.

lib_geometry - added type and source back to the XYObject.h definition. Was making
   backward compatibility too hard for folks.

uXMS info: --serverport, --serverhost are the correct parameters
     info *had* shown that the parameters were server_host and server_port

uXMS - fixed colormap parameter handling. "colormap" is the correct parameter. It 
     is now reflected properly in the --example output. For convenience though, 
     both colormap and color_map are supported.

uXMS - Fixed a bug where proper history_var specifications where still being
    reported as a configuration warning.

pHelmIvP - Fixed a bug where even proper IVP_BEHAVIOR_DIR parameter settings were 
   being flagged with a configuration warning.

pBasicContactMgr:
  - Fixed bug in linear extrapolation calculations of stale contacts
  - changed contact default retirement time to 600 secs (from 3600)
  - CONTACT_RECAP now does NOT include retired contacts
  - Added extrapolation decay and config parameter for overriding default (30,60)
  - Changed CONTACTS_RECAP to publish once per 5 seconds by default, overridable with the 
    the recap_min_interval config parameter
